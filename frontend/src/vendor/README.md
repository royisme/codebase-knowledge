# Vendor Directory

This directory contains original template code and assets that are not actively used in the current implementation but are retained for reference purposes.

## Structure

### `auth/` - Authentication Templates
- `sign-in-2.tsx` - Alternative login page design with background images
- `sign-in-2.tsx` (route) - Route definition for the alternative login page
- `assets/` - Background images and assets used by the alternative login design

## Usage

The current application uses the simplified card-style login page located at:
- Component: `src/features/auth/sign-in/index.tsx`
- Route: `src/routes/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`

The vendor templates are kept for:
1. Reference for future design changes
2. Potential reactivation if needed
3. Preservation of original template assets

## Note

These files are not imported or used in the current build process and are excluded from the main application flow.
